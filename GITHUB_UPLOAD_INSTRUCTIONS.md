# 📤 GitHub Upload Instructions for WYN Link Remote Desktop

## 🎯 Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `wyn-link-remote-desktop`
   - **Description**: `WYN Link Remote Desktop - Complete application suite for remote PC control with web, mobile, and desktop clients`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Your Code
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions. Use the "push an existing repository" option:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /workspace/project

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wyn-link-remote-desktop.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Alternative: Using Personal Access Token

If you prefer using a Personal Access Token for authentication:

### Step 1: Create Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "WYN Link Upload"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

### Step 2: Upload with Token
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /workspace/project

# Add remote with token (replace TOKEN and YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wyn-link-remote-desktop.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
